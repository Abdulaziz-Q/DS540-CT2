Critical Thinking Assignment 2 is part of DS540 (Advanced Python for Data Science) course

### CT2: Manipulating NumPy Arrays

In this critical thinking activity, we manipulate Python-language NumPy arrays. One of the several open-source libraries that the Anaconda Python distribution installs is the NumPy (Numerical Python) library. NumPy is based on over 450 Python libraries. Many common data science libraries are based on or rely on NumPy, such as Pandas, SciPy (Scientific Python), and Keras (for deep learning). The purpose of this critical thinking is to write a program for a 1-D NumPy array to provide the following tasks in the debate:
- Task 1: is to create a one-dimensional (1-D) with 20 numerical items and print.
- Task 2: is to print the dimension of the array.
- Task 3: is to print the array value for index equal 10.
- Task 4: is to slice and print the array between 5 and 15 indexes. Include both of 
the arrays.
- Task 5: is to print the data type of the array.
- Task 6: is to make a copy of the array and print it.
- Task 7: is to make a view of the array and print it.
- Task 8: is to print the shape of the array.
- Task 9: is to reshape the array and print it.
